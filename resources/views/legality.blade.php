                        <p>A game of skill is when a player invests his/her time in learning, practising and refining his skill to
                            perform in a particular game. The Supreme Court noted that games of skill would be where </p>

                                <li>“success depends principally upon the superior knowledge, training, attention, experience
                                    and adroitness of the player. It is also noted by the Supreme Court that a Game of Skill will
                                    have a predominance of Skill Factor.

                                <li>The principal legislation governing gambling in India is the Public Gambling Act, 1867
                                    (“PGA”). The PGA criminalises the act of ‘gambling’ in a public forum and the keeping of a
                                    ‘common gaming house’. The PGA, however, creates an important exception in favour of
                                    games of skill, by stating that the provisions of the PGA shall [not] be held to apply to any
                                    ‘game of mere skill’ wherever played.

                                    conditions and such other related factors. The Outcome achieved by a participant of a
